                        related to a
                        single topic.
                        Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized
                        into paragraphs.
                        This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and
                        thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points. A paragraph is
